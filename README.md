# My-Blender-Projects

Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality and computer games.

#### Here I used Blender 2.79, using any other version may cause some features to not work.
